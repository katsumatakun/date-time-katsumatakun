# Time

1.  Add a Date Class to this project.   This class should have private data for Month, Day & Year.    
2.  Preserve the integrity of Month and Day.   For year, let's stick with A.D. (positive values)
3.  Add a tick() method to the Time class.   Should increment seconds by 1.   Other fields (minute/ hour) should rollover accordingly
4.  Add a nextDay() method to the Date class.   Make sure that the nextDay is also a valid Date  (with appropriate rollover).

Make sure to do frequent commits and push your changes up for Wednesday's class.  (you must have *SOMETHING* committed/pushed)
    If it isn't 100%, come with questions.
